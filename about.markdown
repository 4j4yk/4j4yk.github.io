### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm [Ajay!](https://4j4yk.github.io)

`I always believe in setting a goal, focus on it and finally achieve it; then again, I have another goal to achieve.`

I infer this by remembering tales of my childhood <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1496454200/2375/gokukid.png" width="40"/>; that is how I managed my small to big goals, from learning the `Snake and Ladder` game to becoming a software programmer. I aspire to broaden my knowledge and enthusiasm to solve the demanding problems faced by the industry. I encouraged myself to pursue a master's degree in Management Information systems with zeal to learn more about the latest and upcoming technology with hands-on experience in research projects.

I am an experienced Information Technology professional or (Fullstack Developer) providing end-to-end solutions. I have exposure to Web development, HP Nonstop server & Mainframe application development, with hands-on experience in managing small and large projects using waterfall & agile methodologies in a fast-paced environment.
