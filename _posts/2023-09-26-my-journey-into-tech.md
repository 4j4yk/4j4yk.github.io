When I started studying Computer Science, I never imagined my career's twists and turns. The journey has been challenging and rewarding, from coding my first project in college to leading teams across industries.

It all started with a solid foundation in problem-solving and software development during my Bachelor's, but things took off when I pursued a Master's in Management Information Systems. That's where I began connecting the dots between technology and business—learning how to leverage tech to solve real-world problems.

Fast forward to now, I've spent over a decade working in banking, finance, and e-commerce, taking on roles that pushed me to think strategically while staying grounded in the technical details. Whether it was leading full-stack web development, optimizing database management, or managing teams spread across the globe, I've always been driven by a passion to improve and innovate.

One of the biggest lessons I've learned is the power of collaboration—especially when working with teams in different time zones. Leading projects where you balance tight deadlines, mentor others, and implement cutting-edge technologies has taught me a lot about resilience and adaptability.

Key Takeaways:

* I've faced tight deadlines, but the key has always been strong team communication and clear goals.
* Automation became my best friend. It saved countless hours and streamlined processes, especially when managing complex incidents.
* Mentoring others has been one of the most fulfilling parts of the journey—watching teammates grow while learning from them simultaneously.
* If there's one thing I'd tell anyone starting in tech: Embrace the challenges. They might be tough, but they make you stronger and a better leader.
